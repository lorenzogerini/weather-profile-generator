# weather-profile-generator
The goal posed by this project is to create a model of meteorological parameters to be integrated within a Railway Systems Simulator. To pursue this goal, meteorological data collected through sensors placed in different locations are used. The data were analyzed  and processed so that different weather profiles could be generated following a probabilistic model. 

A **weather profile** is composed by two matrices,  describing *temperature* and *humidity* variations in time and in different locations.
