# weather-profile-generator
The goal posed by this project was to create a model of meteorological parameters to be integrated within a Railway Systems Simulator. To pursue this goal, meteorological data collected through sensors placed in different locations of a city center were analyzed to determine a probabilistc model of meteorological parameters, *temperature* and *humidity*. The model was then used, together with real data, to generate different weather profiles.

A **weather profile** is composed by two matrices,  describing *temperature* and *humidity* variations in time and in different locations.
